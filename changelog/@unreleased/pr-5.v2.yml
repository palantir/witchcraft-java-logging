    Service log formatting quality of life improvements.
    * Parameters which are interpolated into the formatted output are
    no longer included in the trailing key/value parameter pairs, for
    more concise output.
    * Parameters are automatically interpolated into the stackTrace
    field, unsafe throwable messages are easier to follow in a
    development environment.
    * Service log lines include the thread name on which events were
    created, previously this data was not included in the formatted
    output.
